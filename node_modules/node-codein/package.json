I planned on using EventSource but didn't stick to it because one end doesn't buffer the response and there's no flush command like in PHP. So what it does instead is it keeps connections in a waiting state and when it gets something, it writes the response, closing those connections. Then clients will automatically reconnect but in that split-second if there is any pre-connected client (as in managed to connect before any others), that client will get the logs and those who connected the millisecond later, won't get anything. </li>\r\n\t<li>Autocomplete spams your server. Lag is in place and can be tweaked but it'll basically chop-off words when you hit enter.</li>\r\n\t<li>iScroll + expand all + ctrl+f to find properties will lock the whole browser; not sure why, don't care much, just disable iScroll if you're using this tecnhique to find properties.</li>\r\n\t<li>Autocomplete may not appear after using left / right arrow keys or escape. This is intentional, because those 3 keys are GTFO master keys, but if you want the list of suggestions back, type some gibberish and press backspace.</li>\r\n\t<li>The whole source code is haywired or almost haywired.</li>\r\n\t<li>There's no syntax highlighting on the input. It will generate lags.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\r\n<ul><li><b>Where are the variables from my own module? / How do I debug my module?</b><br />\r\n\t\tThis console normally doesn't see them, as it doesn't see scoped (private) variables. Take it as a javascript security feature. But you can always assign them to an object (like \"module\") and make that object global. (module.variable = ...; global.MyModule = module)\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><b>What's wrong about the regular console?</b><br />\r\n\tIts overall buffer size, no syntax coloring, hard to use, no direct input, so forth. If you're familar to webkit's &quot;Inspect Element&quot; console tab, you'll see there are some differences.</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Then what's wrong with Eclipse's V8 Debugger?</b><br /> \r\n\t\tA debugger is something totally different. Well not really but you still need to set breakpoints, stop executions, scope variables, etc. Plus you have to restart Node to put code in. I can make more excuses if necessary.\t</li>\r\n\t<li><b>Why not just fix node-inspector?</b><br />\r\n\t\tI tried. I first tried to pass back stringified objects and decode them in the local console. The problem was that there was a hardcoded limit of 80 characters beyond which the string turned into &quot;str... (length: 2219)&quot;. I'm not sure where this came from but I believe it was built into v8 when it was compiled with Node. I also tried fixing scope:frame:handle problem but it seemed to pass back zeros no matter what. </li>\r\n\t<li><b>Can you help me do X / can you add X / can you fix X?</b><br />\r\n\t\tOpen an issue here on GitHub, 3rd row, 4th button (or something like that), and let's have a look</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Fork, pull, push, drag, chop, send, fax whatever you want you're free to do it.<br />\r\n\tGood luck buddy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>- ketamynx </p>\r\n",
